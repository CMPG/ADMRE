Functional annotation of SNPs characterized by Complete Genomics (Drmanac et al., 2010) and alleles frequences in 3 continents

SNPs were selected with the following characteristics:
- mapped to coding exons of autosomal human genes [Ensembl version 64, September 2011]
- derived and ancestral states of the SNPs could be inferred from the comparison with the chimpanzee and orang-utan genomes
- polymorphic in 42 individuals from 3 African populations and from 5 non-African populations 

The original sequence data have been described and published in R. Drmanac, et. al. Science 327(5961), 78. [DOI: 10.1126/science.1181498]).
